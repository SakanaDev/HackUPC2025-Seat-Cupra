{"chatbot": "Okay, congratulations on your new Cupra TAVASCAN! Let's get that red warning light sorted out.\n\nA red warning light on the instrument panel is a serious matter. It indicates a critical issue that needs your immediate attention. Here's what you should do:\n\n1. **Safety First:** Carefully and safely pull over to the side of the road as soon as possible. Choose a location that is away from traffic and is level.\n\n2. **Consult the Owner's Manual:** The manual is your best friend in this situation! It will tell you exactly what that specific red symbol means. Turn to the section titled **\"Control lamps\"** (look in the index for the page number). Find the matching red symbol, and it will describe the problem. In this case, the red lamp is probably a sign indicating that the electric drive system has been heavily discharged and you need to park safely.\n\n3. **Follow the Instructions:** The description in the manual will tell you what steps to take. It might involve something like checking fluid levels (though in an electric vehicle, these are less common), waiting for something to cool down, or calling for assistance.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Don't Ignore It:** Red warning lights are there for a reason. Ignoring them can lead to further damage to your vehicle or even dangerous situations.\n\n*   **Examples of what it could be**\n    * There may be a fault in the high voltage system.\n    * The electromechanical brake servo may be not working.\n\nIf you are not comfortable investigating the problem yourself or you're not sure what to do, the safest thing is to contact CUPRA assistance or a qualified workshop. The phone number for CUPRA assistance can usually be found in your vehicle documentation or on the CUPRA website."}
